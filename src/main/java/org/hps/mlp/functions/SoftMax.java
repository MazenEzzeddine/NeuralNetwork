/**
 * Created by xschen on 6/6/2017.
 * The soft-max activation function can be used as the output activation function
 * for the multi-class classification as it is a distribution of probability
 * across different output classes, which sums up to 1.
 * The corresponding cost function for the neural network that is suitable for the
 * soft-max output activation function is the cross-entropy cost function, which has
 * the following form:
 *
 * C = - sum_j (t_j * log(y_j))
 * where j is the index of an output class label
 *       t_j is 1 if j is the target class label; 0 otherwise
 *       y_j is the predicted value which the the value returns from from SoftMax.calculate() method for output index j
 *
 * C has the following nice properties
 * C has a very large big gradient when the target value is t_j is 1 and the predicted output y_j is almost zero
 * In other words, C has a very steep gradient if the predicted output is very wrong
